            <h1>Who Actually is Gen Z?</h1>

            <p>It is very obvious their is a strong difference between Generation Z and any other generation there has been. This people are different because they grew up different. Everything is strange going from the crazy trends, to how they view life, all the way to <a href="vocabulary.html">the way they speak.</a></p>
            <p>So who actually is part of the Generation Z? There has been quite the controversy on this subject. In fact, if you do a Google Search on the Gen Z time frame, you get many different answers. However, the general idea includes people born between <strong>1997-2012. </strong> After 2012, we enter a completely different generation, Gen Alpha. </p>
            <p>Generation Z is usually defined as those who grew up at the time of the internet. This is a strange definition, as some of us had little internet influence in our lives while the younger part of this generation has had an incredible amount of technological influence. I guess you could say it really just depends on who you are talking to.</p>
            
            <h2>A Generational Gap</h2>

                <figcaption>The Generation Gap</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I feel like I should recognize a specific group of what is technically considered Generation Z, but also shares strong similarities with Millenials: those born between the years of <strong>1996-2004.</strong> I am part of this group as I was born in 2003, so I am speaking from experience. This gap in the Generation Z did grow up with the internet, but when it wasn't present in day-to-day lives. Having a cellphone in elementary school meant you were very privilaged, but nowadays it's almost a necessity. These years are both <i>not quite</i> Millenials, but also <i>not quite</i> fully Generation Z.</p>
            <p>My husband was born in 2001, so he experienced a similar childhood to me. We both didn't get electronic devices until we were in middle school. He has brought up to me that he believes this generation gap has a higher <strong>work ethic</strong> than the younger people of Gen Z. We can see examples of this when we watch the newer high schoolers work a regular job. Some complain about the work they have to do, some complain about the customers they have to serve, and a lot of them don't even <i>smile</i> to their customers. In other words, even though Gen Z has a wide range of ages, we are not all at the same level. We have our similarities, but we also have our differences. </p>
            
            
            <h2>What Exactly Makes Gen Z Different?</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Race and ethics are more diverse in this generation.</li>
                <li>Contrary to popular belief, members of Gen Z are actually attending college more than other generations.</li>
                 <li>With all of the technological advances, this generation shares distinct differences from older generations.</li>
                 <li>Family dynamics are more diverse and widely accepted in this generation.</li> <li>The exploration of different pronouns are more prominent in Gen Z.</li>
                 <li>The obvious increase in technology is shown across this entire generation.</li>
            </ul>
